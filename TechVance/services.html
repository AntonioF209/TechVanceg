        <p>On the subject-specific page, you'll find a comprehensive section to customize and fine-tune your grades. We understand that different evaluation components play a significant role in your academic journey. Therefore, we provide separate sections for your written and oral grades.</p>

By moving the sliders, you can easily modify the weight of your written and oral grades, aligning them with your institution's grading system or personal preferences.</p>
        <p>Once you've set the desired weight for your grades, our app generates color-coded grades that make it effortless for you to identify and add your scores. Simply press on the appropriate color-coded grade, and it will be automatically recorded as your grade for that specific component.</p>
